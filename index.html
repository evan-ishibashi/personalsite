        <p>Solving a real-life problem: Tracking who is on next at pick-up basketball, and score keeping.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
          I absolutely love this application because I personally benefit from it every week when
          I play basketball at church. I painfully watched as my friend Alvin
          kept track of the order of over 30 people for who was playing next -
          all on pen and paper. That's when the lightbulb went off in my head to build an app
          that kept it all organized.

          One of the quirky cars that I drive is Honda's first ever hybrid car
          that looks like a jelly bean. I have multiple friends who were curious and
          ended up buying one for themselves, so I wanted to create a central
          place for all things Honda Insight. </p>
        <p>
          <br>
          I Leveraged Selenium to web
          scrape, clean, and process used car market listings data from sites like
          Facebook Marketplace, OfferUp, LKQ, and aggregated all the listings
          into one place, and used ChartJS to build a price trends metrics
          dashboard that enables users to make informed buying decisions.

        <p>OpenCV | YOLO | Python | Machine Learning </p>
        <br>
        <p>I wanted to have technology track my basketball shooting percentage for me, so I built
          an application that could do it for me using computer vision and machine learning. I Leveraged
          a deep learning object recognition model called YOLO, and trained it
          on 1000s of photos that I manually labeled. Combined with OpenCV, the model
        was able to make real-time inference on my shot attempts and makes on a video the model had never seen before.</p>
